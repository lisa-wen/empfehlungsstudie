This Streamlit app was developed by 
students of the "Technical Information 
Design" bachelor program ([Bachelor 
Technisches Informationsdesign](https://www.hs-merseburg.de/studium/studiengaenge/technisches-informationsdesign/)) in the 
"Usability Engineering" module during 
the winter semester of 2024/2025 at 
Merseburg University of Applied Sciences. 

The app provides an interface for 
comparing different recommendation 
methods for open data datasets from 
the [umwelt.info](https://umwelt.info/) 
platform.
